#In this code, we predicted when would happen if specific lines of codes were changed. Also, we analzyed the different aspects and parts of the code. 

# Starter code

num1 = 25
num2 = 4
print("Enter a number")
num3 = int(input())

total1 = num1 // num2
total2 = num3 + num2
total3 = total1 - total2


# How many variables are used in the code?
  # Answer: 6 variable are used in the code. 

# Give the line number where an output statement is used.
  # Answer: Line 9. print("Enter a number") will output the words, "Enter a number"

# What symbol is used for variable assignment?
  # Answer: (=) assignment operator 

# What value is stored in total1 at the end of the program?
  # Answer: The value in total1 by the end of the program is the product of the values in num1 and in num2. num1 has a value of 25 and num2 has a value of 4. Therefore, the total1 is assigned the product of 25 and 4 which is 100. 

# What value is stored in num3 at the end of the program?
  # Answer: num3 will have the value of the whole number/integer that the user inputted. 

# Line 8 is changed to total1 = num1 // num2. How would it affect the program?
  # Answer: total1 would be assigned the quotient of the values in num1 and in num2. num1 has a value of 25 and num2 has a value of 4. Therefore, the total1 is assigned the quoient of 25 and 4 which is 6. Therefore, the value in total1 will change to the value of total2 from 6.
